### Hi there 👋

- 📫 I just moved to 🇩🇰 and I live in Aarhus
- 🔭 I’m currently working for [Salling Group](https://github.com/Salling-Group) and also on a new webapp I hope to
  finish by the end of this year
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), ways how [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) can improve
  my workflows, and I'm also experimenting with different libraries & frameworks for Go
- 👯 Just contact me if you want to collaborate on something
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want. Regarding programming, I'm mostly interested in Go, TypeScript,
  Java (... or other typed programming languages, just don't get me started on everything else) and simple 
  frameworks like React, Dropwizard or basically almost every library for Go
- 📫 How to reach me: [in/bitionaire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bitionaire)
- ⚡ Fun facts about me 
  - I love to play the 🎸
  - I appreciate a good user experience, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my own designs
  - I'm a big fan of great architecture (... what may be one of the reasons why I ended up in 🇩🇰)
  - I can eat Kebap every day 🥙

Also, if you never heard of [scrumlr.io](https://scrumlr.io) before, you should definitely check it out. It's a free
tool for remote retrospectives and lean meetings. I'm one of the proud creators of this tool, and the development
wouldn't have been possible if not for some of my dearest friends out there ❤️. Love you all! I hope you enjoy it as
much as I do.

Peace! ✌️
